# 🏁 Line Follower Projecct (2023 - 2024) 🏎️

## Project Description 📘
The Line Follower is an innovative robotic project designed to introduce the principles of automated navigation. Our mission was to create a robot capable of following a track marked by a black line on a contrasting surface. Through this project, we explored concepts such as sensor integration, real-time data processing, and motor control.

## Components

<strong>Non-electronic: 🔨 </strong> 

* 1 ball caster 🏐
* Cardboard for the chassis 
* 2 Wheels 🛞🛞
* Bolts & nuts 🔩
* Zip ties (for keeping the components in place) 🔗

<strong>Electronic: 🔌</strong> 

* Arduino Uno Nano 🧠 
* 2 Mini Breadboard 
* Infrared (IR) Sensors for Line Detection 🚨
* 1 LiPo Battery for Power 🔋
* L293D motor driver 
* 2 DC Motors 🌀🌀
* Wires and Connectors 🔗

## Design Overview 🎨
Our line follower robot features a sleek, white chassis with a low center of gravity for optimal balance 🛠️. It's equipped with a set of infrared sensors that detect the contrast of the black line against the track. A microcontroller acts as the brain, interpreting sensor signals and commanding two powerful motors that drive the wheels. This setup enables our bot to maneuver with precision and grace around the circuit 🔄.

## Performance Highlights ⏱️
The crowning achievement of our line follower is the record lap time of 15.916 seconds 🚀.
