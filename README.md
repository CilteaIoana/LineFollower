# 🏁 Line Follower Project (2023 - 2024) 🏎️

## Project Description 📘
The Line Follower is an innovative robotic project designed to introduce the principles of automated navigation. Our mission was to create a robot capable of following a track marked by a black line on a contrasting surface. Through this project, we explored concepts such as sensor integration, real-time data processing, and motor control.

## Components

<strong>Non-electronic: 🔨 </strong> 

* 1 ball caster 🏐
* Cardboard for the chassis 
* 2 Wheels 🛞🛞
* Bolts & nuts 🔩
* Zip ties (for keeping the components in place) 🔗

<strong>Electronic: 🔌</strong> 

* Arduino Uno Nano 🧠 
* 2 Mini Breadboard 
* Infrared (IR) Sensors for Line Detection 🚨
* 1 LiPo Battery for Power 🔋
* L293D motor driver 
* 2 DC Motors 🌀🌀
* Wires and Connectors 🔗

## Design Overview 🎨
Our line follower robot features a sleek, white chassis with a low center of gravity to ensure stability 🛠️. It is equipped with infrared sensors that detect the contrast of the black line against a lighter track surface. The core processing unit interprets signals from these sensors and sends commands to two robust motors that propel the wheels. This configuration allows our bot to navigate the circuit with precision and agility 🔄.

## Performance Highlights ⏱️
The crowning achievement of our line follower is the record lap time of 15.916 seconds 🚀.
